🙋‍♀️ OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is a powerful tool designed to allow everyone who uses the internet to help improve it. With BLT, users can submit any type of issue they encounter, whether it’s a simple design flaw like a button being the wrong color, or a serious security vulnerability. By following responsible disclosure ethics, BLT helps to ensure that reported issues are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.

🌈 Contribution guidelines The OWASP Bug Logging Tool Project is a community-driven initiative that relies on the contributions of volunteers from all over the world.
