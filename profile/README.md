🙋‍♀️ OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is a powerful tool designed to allow everyone who uses the internet to help improve it. With BLT, users can submit any type of issue they encounter, whether it’s a simple design flaw like a button being the wrong color, or a serious security vulnerability. By following responsible disclosure ethics, BLT helps to ensure that reported issues are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.

🌈 Contribution guidelines The OWASP Bug Logging Tool Project is a community-driven initiative that relies on the contributions of volunteers from all over the world. These dedicated individuals generously donate their time and expertise to help improve the security of the internet for everyone. https://github.com/OWASP/BLT/graphs/contributors
